# Laboratory Task No. 2 NFA to DFA conversion
## Variant: 10

## Implementation
1 .Convert NFA from your variant to DFA on paper, writing all transitions and drawing converted automato.

2. Write program which converts nondeterministic finite automato (NFA) to deterministic finite automato (DFA)

The program can be found inside lab2.cpp file. There is a separate function for parsing the input data, converting the NFA to DFA, as well as for drawing the table for the obtained DFA.

3. Display converted automato in form of graph or transition table
